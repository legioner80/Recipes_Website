            <h2>Ingridients for Dough:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 tea spoon salt</li>
                <li>3 cup warm water</li>
                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
             <h2>Filling:</h2>
             <ul>
                 <li>18 onces ground beef</li>
                 <li>1 small onion</li>
                 <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
                 <li>ground pepper</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>

    <li>Combine egg, vegetable oil, and salt in a measuring cup; add enough water to fill 
        to 1 cup. Pour into a bowl, add 3 cups flour, and 
        knead into a smooth, elastic dough. Cover with a 
        kitchen towel and rest for 30 minutes.</li>


<li>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour.</li>


<li>Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix filling 
    thoroughly by hand or using a fork.</li>


Roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface and cut 
out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a wine glass. Keep the rest of the 
dough covered with a towel to avoid drying out. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of filling 
on one side of the dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using fingers, 
forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
 Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.


<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer and drop small 
    batches of frozen pelmeni into simmering water. Cook and stir until the meat is cooked
     and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking 
    for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.</li>
