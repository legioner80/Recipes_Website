                    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>

                    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                   <li> 12 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
                  <li>  2 (4 ounce) filet mignon steaks</li>
                   <li> 2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
                   <li> 1 teaspoon steak seasoning </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk 1 tablespoon olive oil, butter, onion, wine, Worcestershire sauce, lemon 
                    juice, parsley, seafood seasoning, garlic, and black pepper together in a bowl;
                     add shrimp. Toss to coat evenly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 
                     for flavors to blend, at least 15 minutes.</li>

                
                <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. 
                Coat steaks with 2 teaspoons olive oil; sprinkle with steak seasoning.
                </li>
                
            
                <li>Cook steaks until they are beginning to firm and have reached your desired 
                    doneness, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                    the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a platter 
                    and loosely tent with a piece of aluminum foil.
                </li>
               
            
                <li>  Remove shrimp from marinade and grill until they are bright pink on the
                outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes 
                per side.
                </li>
               
              </ol>
